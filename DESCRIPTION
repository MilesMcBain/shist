Description: Shifting histograms - they're the shist. This package contains one
    funciton `shist()` that allows you to plot a histogram first and choose the bin
    widths later on the fly. Functionality is a thin wrapper around tools provided
    by the mighty hadley's `ggvis`. The point is it's fast, easy and kinda fun.
